# Lox-Interpreters

This is a Lox interpreter made using Java (jlox).
This project is based on the Lox language from the book Crafting Interpreters.

## Resources

[Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters): The official repository for the crafting interperters book.

## Next Steps

- **Add Debugging Features:** Show a call stack or traceback when an error occurs, helping users understand where the issue lies in their code.
- **Repeat in other language:** Creating a Lox Interpreter in a different languge will allow to learning cross platform support for the interpreter.
- **Expand Library:** Add more built-in functions and utilities like file I/O, math operations, and string manipulation to make the interpreter more versatile.
- **Concurrency support:** Add support for asynchronous programming to allow non-blocking I/O operations, enhancing performance in I/O-bound applications.
